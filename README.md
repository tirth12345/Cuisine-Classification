# Task: Cuisine Classification
# Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.
     Steps:
     Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values
     and encoding categorical variables.
     Split the data into training and testing sets.
     Select a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic
     regression, random forest) and train it on the
     training data.
     Evaluate the model's performance using
     appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy,
     precision, recall) on the testing data.
     Analyze the model's performance across different
     cuisines and identify any challenges or biases.
